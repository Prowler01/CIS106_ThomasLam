The user enters a number betwen 0-100
The program tries to guess that number
Using a do loop that guesses teh number
Based on midpoints

Main program:
	Play game
	Display result

Get equality
	Parameters:
		Guess
	Process:
		Display guess
		Get equality (higher/ lower/ equal)
	Return:
		equality

Play game
	Parameter:
		None
	Process:
		count = 0
		low = 0
		high = 100
		loop
			guess = midpoint
			count = count + 1
			get equality
			if equality = higher
				low = midpoint + 1
			if equality = lower
				high = midpoint - 1
			if equality = equal
				end loop, return count
		while equality =/= E:
	Return:
		count

Display result
	Parameters: count
	Process: print count
	return nothing
