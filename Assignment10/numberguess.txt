The user enters a number betwen 0-100
The program tries to guess that number
Using a do loop that guesses teh number
Based on midpoints

Main program:
	Get user_number
	Get equality
	Get computer_guess
	Display result

Get user_num
	Parameters:
		None
	Process:
		Display prompt
		Get user_num
	Return:
		user_num

Get equality
	Parameters:
		None
	Process:
		Display prompt
		Get equality (higher/ lower/ equal)
	Return:
		equality

Get computer guess
	Parameter:
		equality
	Process:
		count = 1
		midpoint = 50
		while equality =/= E:
			print: Is your number higher or lower than +  midpoint
			if equality = higher
				midpoint = midpoint + (midpoint /2 )
				count = count + 1
			if equality = lower
				midpoint = midpoint + (midpoint /2 )
				count = count + 1
			if equality = equal
				end loop, return count
	Return:
		count

Display result
	Parameters: count
	Process: print count
	return nothing
