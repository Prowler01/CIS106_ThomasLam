# CIS106 Thomas Lam

## Assignment 1

My name is Thomas and I'm taking this course because I am interested in computer science. I'm leaning towards a career in this field. From a young age, I've always been captivated by computers and technology so computer science was a very natural career path for me. This is my second time trying this course so I'm equipped with the knowledge of what I did wrong last time and what I did right. Python is a very important programming language will taking this course will without a doubt provide good long-term return on investment in my academic and professional career. Another reason why I'm taking this class is because it's relatively challenging so I will enjoy it more.

## Assignment 2

I learned a lot about programming languages in this session. The most striking thing was just using Flowgorithm. It's been about a year since I've last programmed so reintroducing programming to my brain was a good learning experience. I also learned what the IPO (Input, Process, Output) model is. It seems almost too simple but is extremely effective. A programming can use this super simple 3 step model to break down virtually any program they plan on building. What is also learned is that computer programs operate in a super linear manner. They will execute whatever you put in front of them so it's paramount to get the logic of the program absolutely flawless. I know this will come up again later on in the semester. As for my integrated developer environment, I'm going with Spyder.

## Assignment 3

This session, I relearned some Python fundamentals. I learned how to take user inputs and store them into variables of certain data types. Knowing the basics of programming is an important foundation for computer science majors. These skills will be expanded and built upon in my later academic and career goals. I'm not completely sure what specific subfield of computer science I'd like to pursue, but artificial intelligence has always intrigued me. Maybe in the future I will use the skills I've developed in Python and use them to create bigger and more complex programs that deal with replicating real conciousness. That's not for a couple years at least, but in the near future I'll take more advanced computer science classes where I'll be expected to have the basics of programming. That's really what I've learned during this sessions.

## Assignment 4

In this session I learned about the process of programming. This process involves a lot of debugging, editing, and testing. Although the program may seem simple at first glance, there's many nuances that may prevent it from being perfect. I learned this through submitting my assignment and resubmitting it a couple times to get it completely right. I also took a new approach this week by getting ahead in the course and meeting with the Professor. I've learned that sometimes all you need is a bit of guidance and it's in my best interest to seek that guidance if it leads to my success. Asking questions, being open to being wrong, and open to critique is an invaluable part of learning. This lesson will come up again in my academic future and career future.

## Assignment 5

This week we were introduced to functions which added a learning curve for me. I was able to refer the the text book to see how to write the Flowgorithm program using functions. This chapter taught me a lot about how programming larger programs will look. Larger programs will implement the use of functions to categorize specific tasks. The introduction of functions will prepare me for later in my academic career when more complex programs become the subject of my coursework. If I'm developing a piece of software that aims to gather a large amount of user-data and interpret that data, I will without a doubt want to use functions to better organize my code.

## Assignment 6

In this session, I taught myself to program using functions in Python. It was definitely no simple task as functions can quickly become complicated. The individual functions, return values, user-inputs, parameters, calculations, "display result" module, and main function with all the function calls was a lot to manage. All the moving pieces had to be perfectly inline in order for the program to operate properly. This was the most challenging aspect of session 6. Given the complexity of the program, there is a multitude of spots where the compiler can encounter an error. The development of a functioning program requires intensive comprehensive editing in order to ensure the program operates as intended. Any iteration of the program that isn't completely logically sound with perfect syntax is effectively worthless. This is the most critical lesson I learned within this session. 

## Assignment 7

In this session, the program got a lot more complicated with the addition of conditions. This made the programs much more nuanced and difficult to navigate. But it was a great learning experience because being exposed to more involved programs will only help in developing my computer science abilities. I struggled with some of the logic in the conditions, but I was able to refer to the textbook and figure it out. The valuable part of this week for me was simply being tasked with more complicated programs. This will translate into my later academic career because the programs I will tackle later on in my life will definitely be more involved than just basic Python programs. The exposure to increasingly difficult programs will pay dividends in my academic and career journey.

## Assignment 8

In this session, the focus was "for" loops. For loops proved to be more challenging than I had expected because I am used to using while loops/ repeat until loops. The difficult part was learning the syntax involved the for range() part. My program failed numerous times because of this specific block of code. I had to play around with the parameters and numbers involved in the loop. Eventually, I turned to Youtube to answer my questions. I ended up learning that the first parameter in the range() line is where the loop starts from (including the first number), the second number is when the loop stops iterating (including the second number), and the 3rd number is the increment by which the count increases. This helped answer many of my questions and I was able to successfully create a functioning average grade program using for loops. This translates into my academic career because learning this important skill gets me closer to my associate's degree and ultimately my bachelor's degree in computer science. These skills are essential for me to know if I want my college diploma so this session was definitely a beneificial learning experience.

## Assignment 9

In this session, I continued to explore loops in Python with an emphasis on while loops. I learned that they are very similar to "for" loops which we worked on previously. The application is relatively similar and a bit easier to implement. Overall, this session was incredibly beneficial to my future academic and career endeavors. The most useful aspect of this session was the opportunity to further develop my self-teaching ability as well as my coding ability. I've reached a point in this semester where I feel confident teaching myself how to code in Python using just the textbook, online resources, and a little bit of guidance. This constructivist style of teaching is beginning to work out for me.
