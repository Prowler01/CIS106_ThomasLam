# CIS106 Thomas Lam

## Assignment 1

My name is Thomas and I'm taking this course because I am interested in computer science. I'm leaning towards a career in this field. From a young age, I've always been captivated by computers and technology so computer science was a very natural career path for me. This is my second time trying this course so I'm equipped with the knowledge of what I did wrong last time and what I did right. Python is a very important programming language will taking this course will without a doubt provide good long-term return on investment in my academic and professional career. Another reason why I'm taking this class is because it's relatively challenging so I will enjoy it more.

## Assignment 2

I learned a lot about programming languages in this session. The most striking thing was just using Flowgorithm. It's been about a year since I've last programmed so reintroducing programming to my brain was a good learning experience. I also learned what the IPO (Input, Process, Output) model is. It seems almost too simple but is extremely effective. A programming can use this super simple 3 step model to break down virtually any program they plan on building. What is also learned is that computer programs operate in a super linear manner. They will execute whatever you put in front of them so it's paramount to get the logic of the program absolutely flawless. I know this will come up again later on in the semester. As for my integrated developer environment, I'm going with Spyder.
