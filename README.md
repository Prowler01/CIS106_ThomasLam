## Assignment 1

My name is Thomas and I'm taking this course because I am interested in computer science. I'm leaning towards a career in this field. From a young age, I've always been captivated by computers and technology so computer science was a very natural career path for me. This is my second time trying this course so I'm equipped with the knowledge of what I did wrong last time and what I did right. Python is a very important programming language will taking this course will without a doubt provide good long-term return on investment in my academic and professional career. Another reason why I'm taking this class is because it's relatively challenging so I will enjoy it more.
